## Frontend Refactoring Plan

### Current Large Files Analysis
- `shared-components.js` (900 lines) - 6 classes mixed together
- `ui-utils.js` (701 lines) - 9 utility classes in one file  
- `admin/script.js` (551 lines) - Single massive AdminController

### Refactoring Phases

#### Phase 1: Split shared-components.js (High Priority) âœ… COMPLETED
**Results achieved:**
- Reduced `shared-components.js` from 900 lines to ~15 lines (re-export wrapper)
- Created 6 focused modules totaling ~770 lines (net reduction of 130+ lines)
- Clear separation of concerns achieved
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Fixed navigation role-based display issues

Split into focused files:
- `js/shared-components/base-controller.js` - BasePageController (100 lines)
- `js/shared-components/auth-controller.js` - Auth + Protected controllers (85 lines)
- `js/shared-components/form-handler.js` - FormHandler component (140 lines)
- `js/shared-components/data-table.js` - DataTable component (280 lines)
- `js/shared-components/navigation.js` - Navigation components (150 lines)
- `js/shared-components/index.js` - Main export file (15 lines)

#### Phase 2: Reorganize ui-utils.js (Medium Priority)
Split into logical utility groups:
- `js/utils/message-display.js` - MessageDisplay
- `js/utils/loading-manager.js` - LoadingManager  
- `js/utils/form-validation.js` - Validation utilities
- `js/utils/error-handling.js` - ErrorHandler
- `js/utils/keyboard-shortcuts.js` - KeyboardShortcuts
- `js/utils/auto-logout.js` - AutoLogoutManager
- `js/utils/dialogs.js` - ConfirmationDialog
- `js/utils/index.js` - Main export file

#### Phase 3: Split admin controller (Medium Priority)
Split into feature-based modules:
- `admin/admin-controller.js` - Main coordinator (150 lines)
- `admin/user-management.js` - User CRUD operations (180 lines)
- `admin/record-management.js` - Record CRUD operations (200 lines)
- `admin/admin-utils.js` - Shared admin utilities

### Expected Results
- Reduce largest files from 900+ lines to 50-200 lines each
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Better code reusability
- Estimated effort: 9-13 hours total
