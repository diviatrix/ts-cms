# Frontend Refactor Progress: API Client Split

---

## Progress Update: Step 1A Complete
- Code has been moved to the following files:
  - `api-core.js`: Core API logic, ApiResponse, ApiClient, apiClient singleton, RecordsAPI, AdminAPI, ProfileAPI, UtilityAPI
  - `api-auth.js`: Auth/token helpers and AuthAPI
  - `api-error.js`: Error handling utilities
- `api-client.js` now imports from these modules and re-exports the same API as before.
- No refactoring or renaming has been done yetâ€”just a direct move for safety.

_Next: Update all imports/usages in the files listed in the plan to use the new structure._

---

## Progress Update: Step 1B Complete
- All imports/usages of `api-client.js` in the following files have been checked and confirmed to use the new structure:
  - public/record/script.js
  - public/profile/script.js
  - public/nav/script.js
  - public/login/script.js
  - public/include-nav.js
  - public/frontpage/script.js
  - public/admin/script.js
  - public/admin/modules/cms-settings.js
  - public/admin/modules/user-management.js
  - public/admin/modules/theme-management.js
  - public/admin/modules/record-management.js
  - public/admin/modules/base-admin-controller.js
- No code logic changes were needed, only import path and named import checks.

_Next: Begin the refactor pass (Step 1C) to group related methods, improve naming, and remove unused code._

---

## Progress Update: Step 1C Complete
- All legacy/duplicate code for API and message handling has been removed:
  - `public/js/utils/message-api.js` and `public/js/utils/message-display.js` have been deleted.
  - No code in the codebase imports or references these deleted files.
  - No legacy API methods from the old `api-client.js` are in use.
  - All dynamic imports of `api-client.js` are for the new modular API client only.
- The codebase is now fully using the new modular structure for API and message handling everywhere.

_Next: Continue with further refactoring and grouping of related methods as described in the plan._

---

## Progress Update: Step 1D Complete
- All calls to messages.success, messages.error, messages.warning, and messages.info have been refactored to use messages.showSuccess, messages.showError, messages.showWarning, and messages.showInfo everywhere in the codebase, including controllers, pages, utilities, and admin modules.
- This ensures all messaging is handled by the new unified message system API, as required by the refactor plan.

_Next: Continue with further refactoring and grouping of related methods as described in the plan._

---

## Progress Update: Step 1E Complete
- form-validation.js has been deleted and all validation logic is now handled by form-handler.js.
- This completes the merge of validation logic as required by the refactor plan.

_Next: Continue with decoupling theme logic and further refactoring as described in the plan._

## Step 1: Progressive Split Plan

### File List (after split)
- `public/js/api-client.js`  
  Main entry point, re-exports all APIs. Imports from the new modules.
- `public/js/api-core.js`  
  Contains:  
    - `ApiResponse` class  
    - `ApiClient` class (core logic: request, get, post, put, delete, getHtml, delay, etc.)  
    - Singleton: `apiClient`  
    - `RecordsAPI`, `AdminAPI`, `ProfileAPI`, `UtilityAPI`
- `public/js/api-auth.js`  
  Contains:  
    - Auth/token helpers: `getAuthToken`, `setAuthToken`, `isAuthenticated`, `login`, `register`, `logout`, `getUserRole`  
    - `AuthAPI`
- `public/js/api-error.js`  
  Contains:  
    - Error handling: `handleResponse`, `handleHtmlResponse`, `handleAuthError`, `makeRequestWithErrorHandling`

---

## Step 2: Refactoring Details (Second Pass)
- Group related methods in each file for clarity (e.g., all auth methods together).
- Improve naming if needed (e.g., clarify method purposes, add JSDoc comments).
- Remove unused code (identify any methods not used anywhere in the codebase).
- Simplify exports:  
  - Only export what's needed (avoid leaking internals).  
  - Use named exports for clarity.
- Update all imports/usages in the following files (from PLAN.md):
  - `public/admin/script.js`
  - `public/admin/modules/user-management.js`
  - `public/admin/modules/record-management.js`
  - `public/admin/modules/theme-management.js`
  - `public/admin/modules/cms-settings.js`
  - `public/frontpage/script.js`
  - `public/record/script.js`
  - `public/profile/script.js`
  - `public/login/script.js`
  - `public/nav/script.js`
  - `public/js/shared-components/auth-controller.js`
  - `public/js/shared-components/base-controller.js`
  - `public/js/shared-components/form-handler.js`
  - `public/js/shared-components/data-table.js`
  - `public/js/utils/message-system.js`
  - `public/js/utils/theme-system.js`
  - `public/js/utils/theme-api.js`
  - `public/include-nav.js`
